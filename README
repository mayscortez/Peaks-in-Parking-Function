These are the results of an undergraduate research project conducted at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, CA as park of the Summer 2019 MSRI Undergraduate Program. We worked on enumerating the number of parking functions of length n with no peaks. Although this is still an open problem, we have created some SAGE Math scripts that include functions to compute the number of parking functions of length n with no peaks and more. We've also included all our observations, notes, findings and approaches in a paper.
